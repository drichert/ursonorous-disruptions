Ursonorous Disruptions

An interactive recombination of Kurt Schwitters Ursonate. 
Using the Ursonate score as an audio sequencing guide, 
pre-recorded Ursonate performances are combined with 
user-inputted audio and replayed following the phonetic 
structure of the Ursonate. 

More information, audio samples and early code can be found at
